# ‚è≥ Estimating Time to Build MandArt as a Web App

Since this project involves **WebAssembly (WASM), real-time state management, drag & drop interactions, and dynamic canvas updates**, here‚Äôs a **realistic development breakdown** for an experienced developer.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Estimated Development Timeline

| Phase | Task | Estimated Time |
|------|------|--------------|
| **1. Project Setup & Architecture** | Set up repo, WebAssembly integration, and state management system (Event Bus, Color State, Shape State, File State, etc.) | **8-16 hours** |
| **2. Canvas Rendering & WebAssembly Integration** | Create a robust `Canvas.js` component that listens to state changes and updates visuals dynamically | **16-24 hours** |
| **3. Color & Shape Editor Components** | Implement UI components for selecting colors, updating states, and modifying shapes | **12-18 hours** |
| **4. Drag & Drop System** | Implement smooth reordering of colors with **insertion markers, animations, and state updates** | **10-16 hours** |
| **5. File Handling & Persistence** | Implement **loading/saving files (JSON format), automatic updates, and undo functionality** | **8-12 hours** |
| **6. Event Handling & Optimization** | Debug event listeners, eliminate unnecessary state mutations, and ensure **reliability under heavy interactions** | **10-15 hours** |
| **7. UI/UX Enhancements** | Improve responsiveness, accessibility, keyboard navigation, and mobile compatibility | **10-14 hours** |
| **8. Final Testing & Performance Optimizations** | Identify and fix bottlenecks, optimize render calls, and clean up redundant state changes | **12-20 hours** |
